**Two-Stage Framework: Deep-COPD**

We have developed a two-stage framework called Deep-COPD, which harnesses a suite of advanced deep learning algorithms to monitor COPD Twitter users (referred to as COPD users in this study). The flowcharts illustrating the data retrieval process (Stage 1) and data mining procedures (Stage 2) are depicted in Figure 1 in our manuscript.
