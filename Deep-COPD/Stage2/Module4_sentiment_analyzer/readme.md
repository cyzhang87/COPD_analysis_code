**Module 4: Sentiment Analyzer**

Module 4 is a comprehensive sentiment analysis tool that encompasses both sentiment analysis and emotion detection, providing a multifaceted view of user sentiments. Here's how it operates:

- **Sentiment Analyzer**: The sentiment analyzer employs the Valence Aware Dictionary and Emotional Reasoner (VADER), a widely recognized open-source tool. VADER is adept at accurately assessing sentiments expressed in social media by leveraging a combination of lexicons and rules.

- **Emotion Detector**: The emotion detector is founded on an open-source algorithm tailored for recognizing emotions in Twitter data. This algorithm employs a character-based recurrent neural network trained for this specific purpose. To categorize emotions, this study adopts Plutchikâ€™s emotion wheel model, which encompasses eight fundamental emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger, trust, disgust, surprise, and anticipation.
